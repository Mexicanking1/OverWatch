            About the Farmers Market Coalition
        </b>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            The Farmers Market Coalition is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to strengthening farmers
            markets across the United States so that they can serve as community assets while providing
            real income opportunities for farmers.
            <br><br>

            The Farmers Market Coalition is driven by three complementary goals. We call it our triple bottom line.
            <strong>Farmers earn fair prices for the fruits of their labor by selling directly to consumers. Consumers gain 
            access to fresh, nutritious, local produce. Communities regain a figurative “town square,” experiencing 
            the many positive outcomes of foot traffic and animated public space.</strong> Throughout the USA, farmers markets 
            are achieving these goals. Some are doing it better than others. While we too are dazzled by the bigger 
            markets which assemble hundreds of vendors and thousands of shoppers, size is not our only measure of
            success. Sometimes, it is the smaller farmers market operating in a challenging neighborhood that
            achieves this triple bottom line.
            <br><br>
            The mission of FMC is “to strengthen farmers markets for the benefit of farmers, consumers, and communities.”
            <br><br>
            </p>
            Toward that end, the priorities of FMC are:
            <br><br>

            <ul>
            <li>To serve as an information center for farmers markets.</li>
            <li>To be a voice for North American farmers market advocacy.</li>
            <li>To foster strong state and regional farmers market associations.
            <li>To bring private and public support to the table to sustain farmers markets in the long term, for the benefit of farmers, consumers, and communities.</li>
            <li>To promote farmers markets to the public.</li>
            <li>To develop and provide educational programming and networking opportunities for farmers market managers and farmers market vendors.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
